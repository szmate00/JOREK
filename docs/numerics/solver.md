# JOREK Solver
The implicit time integration scheme implemented by JOREK leads to a **large** and **sparse** linear system of the general form

$$A\,x = b.$$

The matrix $A$ is assembled in a distributed block-COO format (which can be converted to a distributed block-CSR format on demand) and is partitioned by **toroidal Fourier harmonics** and **finite-element nodes**. The solver infrastructure exploits this block structure at both the factorisation and the preconditioning level.

Two high-level solution strategies are supported:

| | **Direct solve** | **Iterative solve** |
|---|---|---|
| Input flag | `gmres = .false.` | `gmres = .true.` |
| Method | Sparse LU factorisation of $A$ | GMRES (or BiCGSTAB) with block preconditioner |
| Strengths | Robust; insensitive to conditioning | Lower memory; scales to large problems |
| Weaknesses | Memory and fill-in grow rapidly | Convergence depends on preconditioner |
| Typical use | Small-to-moderate problems | Large / production runs |

Both strategies support multiple third-party libraries as back-ends and can optionally offload the matrix–vector products to GPU hardware.

The main entry point is `solve_sparse_system()` in
`solvers/mod_sparse.f90`.

## Direct Solvers

When `gmres = .false.` in the input file, the system is passed directly to one
of the supported sparse-direct libraries.  The library is selected at compile
time via flags (`USE_MUMPS`, `USE_PASTIX`, `USE_STRUMPACK`) and at
runtime by the corresponding `use_*` input flags.


> <b><font color="red">Hint</font></b>:
> Factorization of large sparse matrices is an expensive operation and will create a lot of fill-in resulting in increased memory requirements. Thus, for most cases use of the **iterative solver** is recommended! 

---

## Iterative Solvers

When `gmres = .true.`, a Krylov iterative method is used, preconditioned by the
**block harmonic preconditioner** described in the next section.

### GMRES

Left-preconditioned restarted GMRES is implemented in `solvers/mod_gmres.f90`. (A more modern implementation avaliable in selected branches is implemented in `solvers/mod_gmres2.f90`).

The algorithm applies the preconditioner $M^{-1}$ to both the initial residual
and to each new Krylov vector.  Orthogonalisation is performed by a
Gram–Schmidt variant (classical or modified, with or without
re-orthogonalisation, controlled at compile time).  Givens rotations maintain
the upper Hessenberg in triangular form in-place.  After each restart the
solution is updated as $x \leftarrow x + V y$, where $y$ minimises the
preconditioned residual over the current Krylov subspace.

Convergence is declared when

$$\frac{\|r_k\|}{\|r_0\|} < \texttt{gmres_tol}$$

or when the absolute residual drops below a secondary threshold.

Key input parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gmres_m` | 40 | Restart dimension |
| `gmres_max_iter` | 400 | Maximum number of outer (restarted) iterations |
| `gmres_tol` | — | Relative residual tolerance |

### BiCGSTAB

BiCGSTAB (in `solvers/mod_bicgstab.f90`) is an
alternative that requires no restart and uses $O(n)$ memory independent of the
iteration count.  It applies the preconditioner **twice per iteration** (once
for the search direction, once for the stabilizer), which is more expensive per
step than GMRES but avoids restarting costs.  Enable it at compile time with the
`USE_BICGSTAB` preprocessor flag.

> <b><font color="red">Hint:</font></b> Use of BiSCSTAB is generally not recommended.

## Preconditioner

**Preconditioning** is essential in solving linear systems using iterative methods. The matrices resulting from the MHD formulations in JOREK are highly ill-conditioned and iterative methods do not converge without a proper preconditioner.  
We choose a preconditioner$M$ such that we solve the modified left preconditioned system

$$M^{-1}A x = M^{-1}b,$$

where $M$ is "cheap" to invert and $M^{-1}A$ is a reasonably good approximation of the identity.
There exist many "standard" techniques that can be applied to general systems without considering the original problem. These, of course, have the benefit of being "plug-and-play" and work reasonably well for a wide range of problems. When going into very ill-conditioned problems we find most of these approaches to have little to no effect. These cases require more advanced study to create tailored preconditioners to obtain good convergence.

The _block harmonic_ preconditioner in JOREK exploits the **toroidal Fourier structure** of
the MHD system to construct a preconditioner $M$ whose application requires only
independent sparse-direct solves on smaller sub-systems, one per **mode family**.

The preconditioner is set up and applied by
`solvers/mod_preconditioner.f90`.

### Concept

For a purely axisymmetric geometry, toroidal harmonics decouple completely: the
mode-$n$ rows of the system matrix have no coupling to mode-$m \ne n$ columns.
JOREK's matrix does contain inter-harmonic coupling terms (from inter-harmonic coupling terms in the system),
but in many cases the dominant, physics-relevant coupling is intra-harmonic.  The
preconditioner $M$ is therefore built by **grouping the toroidal modes into
families** and assembling one block-diagonal preconditioner matrix per family
that retains all intra-family coupling while discarding the inter-family terms.
Each mode family is then factorised independently by the selected direct-solver
library.

### Mode Family Distribution

Toroidal modes $0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ are partitioned into mode families.
Two strategies are available:

- **Automatic** (`autodistribute_modes = .true.`): mode 0 (axisymmetric) forms
  its own family; remaining modes are paired as $(n_1, n_2), (n_3, n_4), \ldots$
- **Manual**: the user specifies `n_mode_families`, `modes_per_family(:)`, and
  `mode_families_modes(:,:)` explicitly.

MPI ranks are distributed among families in the same way:

- **Automatic** (`autodistribute_ranks = .true.`): ranks are distributed as
  equally as possible across families.
- **Manual**: specified via `ranks_per_family(:)`.

### Preconditioner Solve Workflow

Each GMRES / BiCGSTAB preconditioner application performs the following steps:

1. **Scatter RHS** — extract the rows belonging to this mode family from the
   global residual vector (via pre-computed `row_index` mapping).
2. **Solve** — the family's direct solver (MUMPS / PaStiX / STRUMPACK)
   factorises or reuses, and solves the preconditioner matrix for the local
   RHS.
3. **Gather solution** — contributions from all families are reduced by
   `MPI_AllReduce` (sum) into the global solution vector; each family's rows are
   weighted by `row_factor` (normally 1).

### Factorisation Reuse

Refactoring the preconditioner at every time step is expensive. Thus, we can reuse the factorized preconditioner matrices over multiple timesteps, where they still provide a good approximation of the linear system.  JOREK reuses the existing factorisation (the `solve_only` path) when:

$$\texttt{iter_gmres} + \texttt{iter_prev} \le 2 \times \texttt{iter_precon}
\quad \text{and} \quad
\texttt{n_since_update} < \texttt{max_steps_noUpdate}$$

where `iter_precon` and `max_steps_noUpdate` are input parameters.  When
neither condition is satisfied, the preconditioner matrix is reassembled and
refactorised.

### Preconditioner Matrix Assembly

Two assembly strategies are available (selected by compile-time flag
`DIRECT_CONSTRUCTION`):

- **Direct construction**: each MPI rank assembles its part of the
  preconditioner matrix directly at the finite-element level, without the
  distribution step.
- **Distributed construction**: the full system matrix is communicated via
  `MPI_ALLTOALLV` to the rank groups that own each mode family, which then
  extract their rows locally.

## PETSc Integration

> **Note:** PETSc-based solver paths are under active development.
> This section will be expanded once the implementation stabilises.

When compiled with `USE_PETSC`, an alternative solver path is
available that uses PETSc's KSP framework for both direct and iterative solves.
The PETSc integration layer lives in `solvers/mod_petsc.f90` and exposes:

- A persistent `KSP` context that is reused across time steps.
- An MPIBAIJ system matrix that can be filled from JOREK's native BCSR data.
- Plug-in preconditioners implemented as PETSc `PCSHELL` or `PCFIELDSPLIT`
  objects.

Details of the PETSc-based preconditioners and their configuration will be
documented separately.
