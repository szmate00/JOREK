# Generating Poincaré Plots with Particle Tracker

## What's different to jorek2_poincare

- Option to generate Poincaré plots with particles and not just field lines.
- Output is separated for each marker and includes connection length.
- Output is stored in HDF5 format.

## 1. Compiling and running the code

1. It is recommended to use MUMPS for the particle tracer (set `USE_MUMPS=1` in `Makefile.inc`). 
2. (For plotting you will need numpy, h5py, and matplotlib)
3. Compile the Poincaré program with: `make poincare`
4. Include the binary in the same folder with JOREK inputs and restart files.
5. The simulation options are given in `pncr` file which you should also include in the same folder and contains the following:

    ```
    # n_tracers - number of field line/particle tracers 
    100
    # n_turns - how many times a marker must cross the outer mid-plane before terminating its simulation
    200
    # tstep in [s] for particles and [m] for field lines (1e-3 - 1e-2 is good for field lines, for particles it depends but 1e-8 - 1e-10 is ok for electrons)
    1.0e-10
    # mass [AMU] (if you use 0.0 here then field lines are traced)
    0.00055
    # charge [e]
    -1
    # pitch (vpar/vtot)
    0.99
    # energy [eV]
    1.0e3

    ```

6. You can change the values in `pncr` file but don't alter the structure.
7. The Poincaré data is collected for a single time-slice that corresponds to `jorek_restart.h5`.
8. To run the code, use `mpirun -n 1 ./poincare < input_namelist`

### Further information and possible issues

- Issues can arise if time-step is too large (e.g. field lines diverge or have “width” in the plot or the simulation might not complete). Reducing time-step means simulations take longer time, but you can alleviate this by reducing `n_tracers` and `n_turns`. Running with default settings should take just few minutes.
- Tracing particles by default includes electric field, which can cause acceleration. To disable the electric field, add `E=0` at the end of the subroutine `calc_EBNormBGradBCurlbDbdt` in `particles/mod_fields.f90`.
- When tracing particles, relativistic guiding center pusher is used. This could be an issue when the guiding center approximation is not valid e.g. in spherical tokamaks.
- Markers are initialized at the outer mid-plane at even intervals radially, and the initial toroidal angle is randomly sampled from uniform distribution.
- Field lines are traced in one direction along the B-field vector. For particles this is determined by pitch.

## 2. Compiling and running the code

- The program outputs `poincare.h5` fiel that contains the following fields

```
r       : R-coordinate
z       : z-coordinate
phi     : Toroidal angle [rad]
psi     : Normalized psi
iprt    : Marker ID this data point correspond to (1,...,Nmrk)
pncrid  : Poincare plane this data point correspond to (default is phi-tor plane = 1 and Rz-plane = 2 )
mil     : Distance the marker has travelled up to this point
mileage : The distance [m] that a marker travelled in total
```

- The data is stored in unstructured 1D arrays where each data point corresponds to a crossing of poloidal or toroidal plane. This makes it easy to modify the code so that the data is collected in several (poloidal or toroidal) planes simultaneously.
- `iprt` and `pncrid` can be used to disect the data. For example, to get indices of all points for marker i at plane j, use: `idx = np.logical_and.reduce([iprt == i, iplane == j])`
- At the moment the data is collected at Rz-plane corresponding to phi = 0, and at the outer mid-plane.
The results can be visualized with `util/plot_poincare.py` just by running the script. Here's an example output:

    <img src="assets/particles_poincare/2022_11_22_poincare.png" alt="Poincare plot created using particle tracer" width="600">

- The colors in red hue indicate confined markers (ones that were not lost during the simulation). Each marker is assigned a (red tinted) color from a pool of six colors, which makes it easier to separate adjacent lines.
- The colors in blue hue indicate connection length of the lost markers. The color shows the connection length at that position
