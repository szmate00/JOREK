## Vpar boundary condition smoothing at grazing angles

A smoothing function can be applied to smooth the jumps in parallel velocity boundary condition (Mach=1), which happens where $\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{n} \approx 0$. More information can be found in [1] (subsection 2.1.1).

To use this function, include `vpar_smoothing` in your input file and set proper values for `vpar_smoothing_coef(1)`, `vpar_smoothing_coef(2)` and `vpar_smoothing_coef(3)`. Here is an example used in [1]:

```fortran
vpar_smoothing = .t.
vpar_smoothing_coef(1) = 0.02     ! B.n/B at which the transition takes place
vpar_smoothing_coef(2) = 0.016    ! width for transition the vpar = 0 --> vpar=cs
vpar_smoothing_coef(3) = 0.005754 ! offset to make vpar=0 at 0 degrees
```
