# JOREK Physics Models

## [Reduced MHD](reduced_mhd.md): 

__model 600__ is the workhorse for reduced MHD as it allows users to combine the different physics ($v_\parallel$, separate $T_e$ and $T_i$, fluid neutrals, fluid impurities, ...) they wish to keep in their simulations at [compile](../../compiling/getting_started/compiling.md) time. The variables that are always present in __model 600__ are:

| Variable | Symbol | variable number | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Poloidal magnetic flux: | $\psi$ | 1 |
| Velocity stream function: | $u$ | 2 |
| Toroidal current density: | $zj$ | 3 |
| Vorticity: | $\omega$ | 4 |
| Mass density: | $\rho$ | 5 |
| Temperature: | $T$ or $T_i$ | 6 |

When $v_\parallel$ is used, it is always `var_vpar=7`.

For __model 600__, the variable numbers are assigned at compile time.

In addition to __model 600__, there are older, legacy, reduced MHD models shown below. __However__, new developments are not necessarily included in these models and, as such, users are suggested to use __model 600__.

| Model | Description | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| model199 | No parallel flows | $\psi$ | $u$ | $j$ | $\omega$ | $\rho$ | $T$ | | | | |
| model303/333 | Parallel flows | $\psi$ | $u$ | $j$ | $\omega$ | $\rho$ | $T$ | $v_{\vert\vert}$ | | | |
| model305 | ECCD 1 current model | $\psi$ | $u$ | $j$ | $\omega$ | $\rho$ | $T$ | $v_{\vert\vert}$ | $J_{ECCD}$ | | |
| model306 | ECCD 2 current model | $\psi$ | $u$ | $j$ | $\omega$ | $\rho$ | $T$ | $v_{\vert\vert}$ | $J_{EC1}$ | $J_{EC2}$ | |
| model400 | Parallel flows; separate $T_e$ and $T_i$ | $\psi$ | $u$ | $j$ | $\omega$ | $\rho$ | $T_i$ | $v_{\vert\vert}$ | $T_e$ | | |
| model500/501/555 | Parallel flows and neutral/impurity density | $\psi$ | $u$ | $j$ | $\omega$ | $\rho$ | $T$ | $v_{\vert\vert}$ | $\rho_{n/imp}$ | | |
