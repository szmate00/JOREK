# Runaway electron physics in the particle tracer

## Pushers

Runaway electrons can be traced either by solving the full gyro-orbit or the motion of the guiding center. The gyro-orbit pusher utilizes the volume-preserving algorithm which preserves particle energy and is essentially a relativistic variant of the classical Boris pusher. The guiding center pusher solves the equations of motion with RK4 method, which does not preserve energy. Good starting values for the time-steps are 1e-12 for the gyro-orbit and 1e-11 for the guiding center. The pushers and their implementation are presented in this [publication](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/aa95cd). 

Examples `particles/examples/ex6_jorek.f90` (gyro-orbit) and `particles/examples/ex7_jorek.f90` (guiding center) show how the relativistic pushers are used. 

- The gyro-motion is solved with `volume_preserving_push_jorek` using particle type `particle_kinetic_relativistic`.
- The guiding-center motion is solved with `runge_kutta_fixed_dt_gc_push_jorek` using particle type `particle_gc_relativistic`.

### Radiation reaction force

The radiation reaction force in reactor plasmas is relevant only for energetic (E » 1 MeV) electrons and it can set an upper limit for RE energy. The details of the radiation reaction force implemented in JOREK can be found [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ac75fd/meta). 

The radiation reaction force is enabled by calling a different variant of the particle pusher (these functions both push the marker and account for the radiation reaction force): 

- `volume_preserving_radiation_push_jorek`
- `runge_kutta_fixed_dt_gc_push_jorek_radreact`

### Collision operator

The collision operator is based on the relativistic Fokker-Planck equation, where both plasma and test particle can be relativistic. In particle simulations we are solving the corresponding stochastic equation (the Langevin equation). Therefore particle simulations are not deterministic if collisions are enabled. 

The collision operator is presented [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ac75fd/meta) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465517303326). The evaluation requires that look-up tables for special functions are initialized first. You can generate the data file with (the default settings should be OK for all fusion plasmas): 

1. Uncomment the program in `particles/pushers/mod_ccoll_relativistic.f90`
2. Compile `util/j2p -j 8 mod_ccoll_relativistic`
3. Run (the generated HDF5 file is `ccolldata`) `./mod_ccoll_relativistic`

Additionally, you'll need to initialize the ion data which requires ADAS if impurity species is present (currently code assumes main ion species and one impurity where all charge states are treated as individual species): 

    call init_imp_adas(0)
    call ccoll_init('ccolldata', dat)

- The collisions in gyro-orbit simulations are applied as `call ccoll_kinetic_relativistic_push`
- In the guiding center simulations `call ccoll_gc_relativistic_push`

Note that these methods only update the momentum of the particle according to the collision operator and therefore need to be used in combination with any of the previously mentioned pushers when evolving the particle in time. The particle operator operates on the whole 3D momentum whereas the guiding center operator has different operators for pitch and energy. Therefore it is possible to have only pitch scattering or only slowing down by commenting the corresponding line in . One minor thing is that the guiding center operator does not have spatial operator. This operator accounts for the classical transport so it's contribution is negligible in most cases (the gyro-orbit operator includes it inherently). Neoclassical transport is included in both operators. 

For runaway electrons, the effect of the partial screening on collisions is significant. These can be included by calling: 

- Gyro-orbit: `call ccoll_kinetic_relativistic_push_partialscreening`
- Guiding center: `call ccoll_gc_relativistic_push_partialscreening`

The implementation is based on the formulas found in [Hesslow's thesis](https://research.chalmers.se/en/publication/518256). The limitation is that both operators assume that the test particle is an electron (partial screening is not relevant for ions anyway). Also the gyro-orbit operator is in fact the guiding center operator (we perform guiding center transformation in between) so now the full orbit simulations don't have classical transport either. 

## Benchmark 

When both collisions and radiation reaction force are present, then electrons in presence of an electric field are not accelerated indefinitely but instead they form a so-called bump-on-tail distribution. We use this fact to benchmark the implementation. There are no analytical results, however, so the comparison is done with respect to kinetic code DREAM. The test code, which can also be used with actual JOREK data with small modifications, is located in `particles/examples/test_bump.f90`. 

The results: 

<img src="../../assets/runaway_electron_pushers/Test_bump_corrected.png" alt="Kinetic results agree with DREAM result" width="300">

Results agree with DREAM result. 

<img src="../../assets/runaway_electron_pushers/2022_test_bump_noe.png" alt="Kinetic results without E field return Maxwellian distribution" width="300">

Turning off the electric field in JOREK produces Maxwellian distribution as expected. 

<img src="../../assets/runaway_electron_pushers/2022_test_bump_ps.png" alt="Excellent match for the bump when the partial screening method is used" width="300">

Excellent match with on the bump when using the partial screening model. However, in theory there should be no difference as this test has hydrogen plasma. Therefore the difference is likely due to fact that the partial screening model uses expressions where incident particle is assumed to be highly energetic electron (in particular for the Coulomb logarithm). This could also explain why the Maxwellian is not reproduced that well unless it is an issue with timestep/Monte Carlo noise.
